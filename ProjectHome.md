# V-Strom + Computer --> Stromputer! #

An Arduino based project, that adds the following features to a Mk1 (2004-2011) Suzuki V-Strom Motorcycles (DL650, DL1000):
  * Auxiliary LCD display that can reside on the handle bar
  * Automatic adjustment of LCD display back light using a photo sensor (i.e. at darkness dim LCD display, at full bright day brighten display)
  * Show battery level indicator in volts (LCD)
  * Show ambient/air temperature (F or C) (LCD)
  * Digital LCD Display of gear position
  * Analog display of gear position using 6 LEDs
  * Configuration and diagnostics shell (command line), with a laptop and USB using Putty or Arduino IDE - can be done while bike is running!
  * Upgrade of Firmware through USB port - can also be done while bike is running.
  * Other future features - Show accurate fuel gauge (in %), Show fuel consumption (MPG or KM/L), Fix fuel gauge to become linear, Show air humidity, GPS Track Recorder, Internet Position Notifier ("Spot" like functionality but via 3G internet)

# DIY Cost: About $70! (in a full water resistant enclosure) #
Compare that to commercial gear indicators/battery indicator/temperature gauges.

Current status: Fully Functional (V1.09 - As of 2/7/2013)
