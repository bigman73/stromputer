#Assembly Instructions for Stromputer V1

= Introduction =

Stromputer V1 (As of 9/3/2012) is a fully functional prototype that process and displays the following information:
1. Battery voltage level (0.1V accuracy)
2. Current Gear position
  2.1 Digital (i.e. 1..6 or N)
  2.2 Analog (using 6 LEDs)
3. Ambient temperature (in F or C, 0.1 degree accuracy)


Stromputer is composed of two main components:
1. Brain
  1.1. 10-25V -> 9V DC voltage regulator
  1.2 Arduino Duemilanove
  1.3 Arudino Shield
2. Display
  2.1 LCD (communicates over I2C protocol)
  2.2 Gear position display (6 LEDs)
  2.3 Light Sensor (CdS)

The components communicate between them using the I2C protocol, over 2 LAN wires (RJ-45)
