= Introduction =

Stromputer V1 (As of 9/3/2012) is a fully functional prototype that process and displays the following information:

  * Battery voltage level (0.1V accuracy)
  * Current Gear position
    # Digital (i.e. 1..6 or N)
    # Analog (using 6 LEDs)
  * Ambient temperature (in F or C, 0.1 degree accuracy)


Stromputer is composed of two main modules:
  # Brain
    # 10-25V -> 9V DC voltage regulator
    # Arduino Duemilanove
    # Arudino Shield
  # Display
    # LCD (communicates over I2C protocol)
    # Gear position display (6 LEDs)
    # Light Sensor (CdS)

The components communicate between them using the I2C protocol, over 2 LAN wires (RJ-45)

=== Brain Module ===
At the center of the brain module is the [http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardDuemilanove Arduino Duemilanove]
The Stromputer's logic is running as firmware on the Arduino.
On top of the Arduino is attached an Arduino Prototype Shield.
On the shield there are several circuits:
  # Power supply - 10-25V -> 9V DC Voltage Regulator
  # Battery Voltage divider. It converts a battery voltage level (maximum 20V) into a 0-5V range.
  # Gear Voltage divider. It converts a 0..5.5V level into 0..2.75V level
  # Light sensor input circuit
